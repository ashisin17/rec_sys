# CS145 Final Project â€” Team Coolios

## Project Overview

We implemented and evaluated content-based, sequence-based, and graph-based recommendation models to maximize **discounted revenue** using the Sim4Rec framework. Our final models include:

- `GradientBoostRecommender` (Checkpoint 1)
- `TransformerRecommender` (Checkpoint 2)
- `LightGCNRecommender` (Checkpoint 3)

Our submission combines price-aware scoring, sequence modeling, and graph-based collaborative filtering.
